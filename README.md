* **[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)** - Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden
* **[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)** - Postgres is an object-relational database management system
* **[Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara)** - Capybara aids in testing web applications by providing a simulated environment for how a user would interact with the app.
* **[Rspec](http://rspec.info/)** - Rspec is a test framework for testing Rails applications
